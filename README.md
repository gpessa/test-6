# Decisions

- **Typescript:** I love it! Make my day better and improve my code. It add more works but on a long run it reduce bugs and helps on refactoring
- **CSS Modules:** in the past I was using BEM to name my css classes, after I discover CSS Modules and I felt in love. It allow you scoping, the class name are shorter, less problem on naming conventions.

## Things I would improve on a real project

- **Responsive images:** given your website is full of images I would handle better the different images used in different screen resolutions.
- **Accessibility:** I would add title on the images, make buttons more accessible. More semantich html could be used. etc.
- **Schema.org | https://schema.org/House:** I would add attributes by creating a structured data markup schema supported by major search engines. This would help with search engines.
- **state managment:** I would use a state managment technology (redux) to store data and separate logic.
- **tests:** I would implement tests on each component/hook. Now only few are covered due to the 4 hours limit I had to complete the test.
- **security**: I would hide the temporary key to access the API. I would definitely use less : dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- **browser compatibility**: I would test more carefully the page in the required browsers.
